# KLLU
A Scalable Logic Lab Unit That Implemented in Software Form

KLLU is an abbreviation for Knowledge's Logic Lab Unit. This software is written in C#, and runs on any .NET compliant system. This project aims to implement completely functional emulated LLU, so that can be used for available logic circuit education.

## Specification
- 1 GND, 1 +-5V, 1 9V, 1 +-15V, 1 AC 5V(Variable Frequency),
- Voltage load meter, Overload warning, Variable resistance
- 16 input switches, 8(4+4) output LED and Hexadecimal printer, Common mode changer(Cathode-Anode)
- 3 Variable clock generator and outputs

## Why did you make this?
For I'm a CS undergradate student(2019), I took a logic design course and the equipment does not work properly even lines/units were right place. This made me really annoyed, so I decided to make this program.

## Why "Knowledge"?
See the last paragraph of README in [knowledge-vm](https://github.com/0x00000FF/knowledge-vm).
